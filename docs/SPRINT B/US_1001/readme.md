- As Manager, I want to be able to register Teachers and Students, as well as Managers [Register Users](../US_1001/readme-RegisterUsers.md)
- As Manager, I want to be able to disable/enable users of the system [Change Users State](../US_1001/readme-ChangeUsersState.md)
- As Manager, I want to be able to list users of the system [List Users](../US_1001/readme-ListUsers.md)
