## 1. Description of the Project

**Learning Systems (LS)** is an IT company specialized in the development of learning solutions wanting to develop a new remote learning platform called **eCourse**. 

The platform supports the activites of the 3 (three) major actors of a course, such as teachers, students and managers and several functionalities. The most distinctive features are **Automated Exams** and **Shared Boards**.

The first one guarantee that students automatically have feedback and resulting grades after submitting an exam. The second one is a board that is used to share and organize ideas an information.

The platform is also able to manage:

- **Courses** (create, open/close enrollment, open/close course, define teachers, approve/reject enlistment);
- **Classes** (schedule a class, schedule an extra class, update schedule);
- **Exams** (create, list, list course exams, take exam, list grades, list course grades);
- **Shared Boards** (create, share, view history, archive);
- **Post-It** (create, change, undo change);
- **Meetings** (schedule, cancel, accept/reject, list);
- Other type of requirements that should be taken into account for the given problem.

The duration of this project is 3 (three) months, starting on February 22th and ending on June 18h.
